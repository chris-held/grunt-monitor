grunt-monitor
=============

An (eventually) easy to configure monitoring solution

#Setup

* Copy sample-config.js into a new file named config.js and enter in the servers you want to monitor and
any email configurations you want to set up.

run with grunt

or as a background process with (grunt &)

##TODOS

* debug emailing and figure out why nothing's getting sent out
* refactor this into a standalone task
* possibly remove grunt altogether (it's not much of a grunt task anymore)
